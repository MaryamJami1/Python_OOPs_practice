"""Create two classes, Cat and Robot. Both should have a method make_sound() â€” 
for Cat it returns "Meow", and for Robot it returns "Beep".
Write a function animal_sound(animal) that takes any object and 
calls its make_sound() method (without checking its type).
Test it with objects of both classes."""
